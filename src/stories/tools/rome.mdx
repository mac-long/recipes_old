# Rome vs. ESLint & Prettier.

Here you can see Rome compared to ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting. The script ran formatting and linting on `57` files.

The numbers correlate to: `Time Taken` / `CPU Usage`.

### Script for Testing
You can run these tests yourself with this super quick little shell script written in zsh, just replace `{script}`. e.g. `rome check --write`.

```shell
for i in `seq 1 5`
do
  time {script}
done
```
> ❗️Note:
>
> Make sure to add `'!.next'` when running Prettier.
> <br/> e.g: `prettier --write . '!.next'`
> This is as you don't generally format build output as it's not commited.
