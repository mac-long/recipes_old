# Super Simple Recipes

SSR is a **Super Simple Recipe** blog that utilizes ChatGPT to generate recipes and skips the 4-page story before getting to the instructions. Try making some of these crazy good meals.

This is a fun little app originally intended to learn the Next.js App Router, however I became enamoured with the project and decided to build it into a full application. I ended up learning a lot more than just the App Router.

I call this the buzzword stack and it pretty much uses anything that gets regular coverage in web development media whether that's in [blog posts](https://medium.com/tag/technology), podcasts like [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) or any other online content. Some tools I consider 'Buzzword Stack Worthy' are Storybook, Jest, Next.js, Sentry and OpenAI.

It has been a ridiculously good lesson on hybrid server/client-side rendering. The `use client` notation for files that require reactivity, along with every other file being server-side rendered, makes for some speedy applications. The developer experience is solid too.
