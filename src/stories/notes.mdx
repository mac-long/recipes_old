# Key Development Notes

- Kysely interfaces beautifully with the Vercel Postgres creating simple dot notated typesafe SQL querys.
- Husky will Format, Lint and run all tests before commits to ensure only good code is pushed to the remote. It will also lint [commit messages](https://conventionalcommits.org).
- Nodemailer utilises a gmail application password to send out emails via Vercel's cron functions.
- The OpenAI prompt is carefully crafted to ensure a good JSON response each time.
- Sentry provides error tracking and logging for detailed reports on what went wrong.
- Typescript keeps developers from making little mistakes regulary, saving lots of time in the long run.
- Storybook is a great way to view your components and build them in isolation.
- Chromatic allows for automated testing and ui review. Link stories to Figma components.
- GitHub Actions runs some CI scripts to ensure code is up to scratch.
- Rome for Linting and Formatting. It's super quick, see the table below.
