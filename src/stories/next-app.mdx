## Notes For Future Apps

- Might be a good idea to setup all the testing / automation at the start to ensure bets dev experience. Storybook, CI + Testing etc. I wasn't expecting it to be a large project so ended up putting it all off, however after countless clicking and sending of the form I can see how some E2E testing setup with `@storybook/testing-library` would have made the constant switching around of ideas a little cleaner.
